Interactive Voronoi
=========================

This is a silly program, written in Rust and using Piston (SDL / OpenGL). It allows you to interactively create Voronoi diagrams.

[Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uBe5CkFXlM)

Tips:
* Press `R` to get _n_ random dots (default 50).
* You can use `-l` to draw lines only, no polygons. This mode is somewhat glitchy :)
* You can use `-r` to control the number of random dots that appear when you press R.
* You can press `N` to clear the screen.
